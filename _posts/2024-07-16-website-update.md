title: "Website update"

If you are reading this and have visited before, you probably noticed that my website has significantly changed. It has evolved just as much as my approach to creating it. Instead of writing it in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to use the Jekyll framework, which makes updating it much simpler and allows me to run a blog, which you are currently reading. Thanks to the "no style, please!" theme, it is also visually pleasing and highly optimized. This also saves me time, which, as we all know, is priceless.

If you have any feedback or suggestions regarding this website, feel free to contact me ;)
